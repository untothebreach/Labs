  <p>Hello world! My name is Mohamed and I am a senior at Hunter College
    currently studying English Language and Literature. In my free time I love
    to play the bass guitar, spend time with family and friends, and tinker with
    electronics. By the end of this course, I aim to gain and hone the abilities
    needed to be a successful web developer and start thinking like a programmer
    would. <p>
